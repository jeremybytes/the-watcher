# the-watcher
All the incentive you need to write clean code

This application is a companion to the presentation "Code is for Humans".

Note: if you run the executable directly, you will need to kill the "Watcher" application in Task Manager. 
There are no UI elements to exit the application directly.

Code is also in a pretty rough state. Use your experience creating clean code to make the code easier to read.
